# TrafficSIgnalSimulation

Overview
TrafficLightSimulation is a simple Java program that simulates a traffic light system for an intersection. The program runs a basic traffic light cycle (Yellow, Red, Green) using Java threads, with adjustable durations for each light phase. This simulation helps visualize traffic flow management and can be expanded for more complex traffic control systems.

Features
Traffic Light Cycle: Simulates the Yellow, Red, and Green light phases.

Threaded Execution: Utilizes Java's Thread class for simulating real-time traffic light changes.

Color-Coded Output: The traffic lights are color-coded using ANSI escape codes (Yellow, Red, Green) in the console.

Customizable Timings: Adjust the timing of each traffic light phase (Yellow, Red, Green).

Multiple Cycles: Simulates multiple cycles of the traffic light system.
